# The code here is for the question 2
# The question is related to Range-Frequency Theory (RFT)
# Here I created a function RFT which calculates r(RFT values), RFTP (RFT prediction), Range (Range) and Freq (Frequency)
# RFT is the one I used for the assignment
# RFTG is the RFT Generalised function that is the simplified version of RFT
# part_2_modified is the code I have modified based on my answer
# Part_2_general is to generalise my part_2_modified. However no table is created

# There are four sets of price distributions in the question
# The intuition is to combine all into one and examine each row

# Use them at your own risk
